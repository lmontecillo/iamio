                        <p>   No Webstorm, so I improvised - like a big girl, mommy :D  </p>
             
               <p>   If at first you don't succed: try something else... </p>

      <p>This is where I tried to insert an object to embed, that won't show yet...</p> 
      
      <p><h2 style="color:blue;text-align: center;">Crap... </h2></p>
                  
          
                                 <p>  I'm going to try to dump a *LINK* here some time
                           to the testcontrol page:
                           https://lmontecillo.github.io/ioghost/ - which is in some strange state of primordial chaos...</p>
      
      <p> Is there a limit to how many lines of text this page will display? Hmmmmmm.... Because it's already been acting a little fussy </p>
                                                      
       <p> So, I'm just going to use this as an ongoing joke untill I master the babysteps (Bambi stumbling. Blink. Blink) </p>
       
                           <p>  This was supposed to be really cute O_O  </p>
            
            <p>  Maybe another experiment...  </p>
