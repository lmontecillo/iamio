                        <p>   No Webstorm, so I improvised - like a big girl, mommy :D  </p>
             
               <p>   If at first you don't succed: try something else... </p>

      <p>This is where I tried to insert an object to embed, that won't show yet...</p> <p>Crap...</p>
                  
          
                                 <p>  I'm going to try to dump a *LINK* here some time
                           to the testcontrol page:
                           https://lmontecillo.github.io/ioghost/ - which is in some strange state of primordial chaos...</p>
      
      <p> Is there a limit to how many lines of text this page will display? Hmmmmmm.... Because it's already been acting a little fussy </p>
                                   
               
               <object>
              <script src="https://gist-it.appspot.com/lmontecillo/iamio/blob/master/modultest1.js>
                           </object>
                          </script>
                  
                           
                           
                <p>
               So, I'm just going to use this as an ongoing joke untill I master the babysteps (Bambi stumblin. Blink. Blink)
            </p>
            
            
                           <p>  This was supposed to be really cute O_O  </p>
